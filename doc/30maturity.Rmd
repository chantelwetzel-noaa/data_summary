# Maturity data {-}

Maturity samples for a wide range of West Coast groundfish species have been collected across a range of sources: NWFSC WCGBT survey, NWFSC HKL survey, Pacific hake survey, at-sea sampling of the Pacific hake fishery, and port sampling by ODFW and WDFW. Samples have been collected between 2009 - 2022. The following summary does not include collection from the 2023 NWFSC WCGBT and HKL surveys.
