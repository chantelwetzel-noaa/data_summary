# Introduction

This document provides a detailed summary of available data that may be used to support assessments in 2023. In previous assessment prioritizations, data summaries have only been available in the Assessment Prioritization Workbook (in excel) on the tab called "Data Availability" where summaries of average sample available across select years and data sources were detailed by species.  This summary attempts to provide the same data but in more detail. A detailed summary of data available by year and across sources call allow the Pacific Fishery Management Council (the Council) and advisory bodies to understand the coverage of data across time (e.g., are data available across many years or only recent years?) in a more comprehensive fashion than can be gleamed from summaries of average samples per year.  

Data from Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN), Recreational Fisheries Information Network (RecFIN), and the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (WCGBT) and NWFSC Hook-and-Line (HKL) surveys are summarized.  There may be additional data, not summarized here, from additional data collection programs that could be used to support stock assessments of specific species (e.g., California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program). 

Commercial data summaries were obtained and downloaded from PacFIN on November 22, 2021 with 2021 data updated on April 19, 2022 via the BDS501 report. The number of sexed and unsexed fish, length samples, read ages, and otoliths samples by species, state, and year were summarized.  Otolith collection data was summarized using separately provided state sample summaries, generally for more recent years, and then combined with otolith sample records available in PacFIN (e.g., AGE_STRUCTURE_CODE) for earlier years. Otolith records were provide directly from the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) for 2002-2021 and California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) for 1960 - 2021 (only samples from 1980 - 2021 are summarize). Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) confirmed that otolith records in PacFIN were correct and recommended using these data directly. Summaries of otoliths from early data years (e.g., 1980 - 2001) for Oregon and Washington were based on PacFIN records. Summaries of otolith collections across all years were provided for completeness.  However, there are a number of reasons why otolith counts in early years (e.g., 1980) may not reflect actual otoliths that could be effectively aged (e.g., unable to locate, otolith degradation).

Recreational data summaries were obtained and downloaded from RecFIN on December 2, 2021 with 2021 data updated on April 19, 2022 via the BDS501 report which includes data for the following range or years by state: Oregon 1999-2021, and California 2003-2021. Recreational sample data for Washington was provided directly by WDFW with data ranging from 2002 - 2021. The number of sexed and unsexed fish, length samples, and read ages samples by species, state, and available years were summarized from each data source. Otolith collection counts by species and year were provided separately by each state: WDFW 2002-2021, ODFW 2001-2021, and CDFW 2016-2021. 

Data collected by the two surveys conducted by the NWFSC are summarized: the WCGBT and HKL surveys. Data collected by the NWFSC WCGBT survey between 2003-2021 and 2004-2021 by the NWFSC HKL survey by species are summarized. Similar to the summaries provided for the commercial and recreational fisheries; sexed and unsexed fish, lengths, read ages, and otoliths collected are available by year. Additionally, the number of tows (NWFSC WCGBT survey) or the sites (NWFSC HKL survey) that observed each species by year are provided. 

Indices of abundance were calculated using VAST, a spatiotemporal model, for species well-observed by the NWFSC WCGBT survey and presented as area-wide estimates (i.e., coastwide for many species) along with area-specific (e.g., state boundaries) based on species. VAST was run using a generalized set-up across species using the Tweedie distribution, with the dispersion parameter held constant across years with 500 knots used to create the mesh for most species. Due to extreme catch events observed along with other species-specific data attributes, VAST was run assuming the lognormal distribution for Pacific spiny dogfish, petrale sole, widow rockfish, and longspine thornyhead. Future species-specific indices of abundance created with VAST would likely select a more tailored approach for model settings (e.g., knots, distributions) which could result in slight changes in year-by-year values for the indices of abundance. The indices of abundance presented here should only be considered illustrative of potential trends in abundance across time.   

The length data collected by the NWFSC WCGBT survey were expanded using a generalized stratification. The composition data were expanded using a design-based approach with strata based on state latitudes with two depth strata: 55 - 183 m and 183 - 549 m, for all species except for three.  The three exceptions were species with considerable biomass at depths greater than 549 m: Dover sole, longspine thornyhead, and shortspine thornyhead. These three species had an additional depth strata that included deeper waters, 549 - 1280 m, for each state area. The expanded length composition data were summarized using either a 2 or 4 cm bin structure depending upon the range between maximum and minimum lengths observed within the survey data.  Species where the range between the maximum and minimum lengths observed by the survey were less than 60 cm, 2 cm data bins were used, and for species where the range was 60 cm or greater the data bins were set at 4 cm. All length observations were treated as unsexed fish for simplicity and for ease of observing potential trends in length observations across time. The generalized stratification and bin structure selected here provides a simple summary of the data that can be useful for decision making, but will likely differ from a species specific approach that would be selected in a future assessment. Additionally, the NWFSC WCGBT survey selectivity for each species will impact the lengths observed and has not been explicitly accounted for in this analysis.

Indices of abundance were estimated from the NWFSC HKL survey for well-observed species using a Bayesian Generalized Linear Model that accounted for site, angler, drop number, and hook number. Additional covariates that would typically be explored when developing species-specific indices for use in stock assessments were not explored in this analysis for simplicity. The NWFSC HKL extended sampling in the Cowcod Conservation Areas (CCA) starting in 2014. Indices of abundance for this survey are often explored by splitting the data three alternative ways: 1) all data outside and within CCAs across all years, 2) outside the CCAs for all years, and 3) inside the CCAs only starting in 2014. Once again, for simplicity, indices were calculated for all species using all available data outside and within the CCAs combined.

The length data collected by the NWFSC HKL survey were summarized to reflect the proportion of observations by species, length bin, and year. Similar to the index data, observation outside and within the CCAs were combined. The length composition data were summarized using either a 2 or 4 cm bin structure depending upon the range between maximum and minimum lengths observed within the survey data. Species where the range between the maximum and minimum lengths observed by the survey were less than 60 cm, 2 cm data bins were used, and for species where the range was 60 cm or greater the data bins were set at 4 cm. All length observations were treated as unsexed fish for simplicity and for ease of observing potential trends in length observations across time. Similar to the NWFSC WCGTB survey, the selectivity of the NWFSC HKL survey for each species will impact the lengths observed and has not been explicitly accounted for in this analysis.
