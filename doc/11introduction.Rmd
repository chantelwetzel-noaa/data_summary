# Introduction

This document provides a detailed summary of available data that may be used to support assessments in 2023. In previous assessment prioritizations, data summaries have only been available in a tab (called "Data Availability" in the Assessment Prioritization Workbook in excel where summaries of average sample available across select years and data sources were detailed by species.  This summary attempts to provide the same data but in more detail. A detailed summary of data available by year and across sources call allow the Pacific Fishery Management Council (the Council) and advisory bodies to understand the coverage of data across time (e.g., are data available across many years or only recent years?) in a more comprehensive fashion than can be gleamed from summaries of average samples per year.  

Data from Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN), Recreational Fisheries Information Network (RecFIN), and the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (WCGBT) and Hook-and-Line (HKL) surveys are summarized.  There may be additional data, not summarized here, from additional data collection programs that could be used to support stock assessments of specific species (e.g., California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program). 

Commercial data summaries were obtained and downloaded from PacFIN on November 22nd, 2021 via the BDS501 report. The number of sexed and unsexed fish, length samples, read ages, and otoliths samples by species, state, and year were summarized.  Otolith collection data was summarized using separately provided state sample summaries, generally for more recent years, and then combined with otolith sample records available in PacFIN (e.g., AGE_STRUCTURE_CODE) for earlier years. Otolith records were provide directly from the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) for 2002-2021 and California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) for 1960 - 2021 (only samples from 1980 - 2021 are summarize). Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) confirmed that otolith records in PacFIN were correct and recommended using these data directly. Summaries of otoliths from early data years (e.g., 1980 - 2001) for Oregon and Washington were based on PacFIN records. Summaries of otolith collections across all years were provided for completeness.  However, there are a number of reasons why otolith counts in early years (e.g., 1980) may not reflect actual otoliths that could be effectively aged (e.g., unable to locate, otolith degradation).

Recreational data summaries were obtained and downloaded from RecFIN on December 2, 2021 via the BDS501 report which includes data for the following range or years by state: Oregon 1999-2021, and California 2003-2021. Recreational sample data for Washington was provided directly by WDFW with data ranging from 2002 - 2021. The number of sexed and unsexed fish, length samples, and read ages samples by species, state, and available years were summarized from each data source. Otolith collection counts by species and year were provided separately by each state: WDFW 2002-2021, ODFW 2001-2021, and CDFW 2016-2021. 

Finally, data collected by two surveys conducted by the NWFSC are summarized: the WCGBT and HKL survey.  Data collected during the 2021 sample season are not yet available but should be available for discussion during the next scheduled Assessment Prioritization agenda item at the June Council meeting. Data collected by the NWFSC WCGBT survey between 2003-2019 and between 2004-2019 by the NWFSC HKL survey by species are summarized. Similar to the summaries provided for the commercial and recreational fisheries; sexed and unsexed fish, lengths, read ages, and otoliths collected are available by year.  Additionally, the number of tows (NWFSC WCGBT survey) or the sites (NWFSC HKL survey) that observed each species by year are provided. 

In the 2020 Assessment Prioritization a summary of length compositions and indices from the [NWFSC WCGBT data](https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2020/05/f-2-attachment-1-summary-of-the-nwfsc-west-coast-groundfish-bottom-trawl-survey-data-for-select-species-from-2003-2019.pdf/) were provided.  Since data from the 2021 sample season is not yet available for summary, no new length compositions or indices were calculate with the summaries from 2020 representing all available data (e.g., no 2020 sampling season due to COVID-19).  Depending upon data availability, similar data summaries could be provided at the June Council meeting.

<!-- =====================================================================
A brief summary of the NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl (WCGBT) and NWFSC Hook & Line Surveys is presented here for data available from 2003 - `endyr`.  These analyses are meant to provide additional information and guidance for the 2022 assessment prioritization process.  The selection of the species from the WCGBTS was based on having an average of 20 or more positive tows by the survey per year.  

The indices were calculated using VAST and the biomass estimates were aggregated by a generalized approach using state boundaries based on the areas where observations were present. Future species specific assessments may select a more tailored approach for summarizing the NWFSC WCGBTS data by area.  

The length data also were expanded using a generalized stratification. The composition data were expanded using a design-based approach with stratas based on state latitudes with two depth stratas: 55 - 183 m and 183 - 549 m, for all species except for three.  The three exceptions were species with considerable biomass at depths greater than 549 m: Dover sole, longspine thornyhead, and shortspine thornyhead.  These three species had an additional depth strata that included deeper waters, 549 - 1280 m, for each state area. The expanded length composition data were summarized using either a 2 or 4 cm bin structure depending upon the range between maximum and minimum lengths observed within the survey data.  Species where the range between the maximum and minimum lengths observed by the survey were less than 60 cm, 2 cm data bins were used, and for species where the range was 60 cm or greater the data bins were set at 4 cm.  The generalized stratification and bin structure selected here provides a simple summary of the data that can be useful for decision making, but will likely differ from a species specific approach that would be selected in a future assessment.
